# Social-Buzz-Data-Analysis
This project was part of a data analytics job with Accenture on Forage. The goal of the project was to analyze social media data to identify trends, evaluate performance, and provide actionable recommendations for enhancing online engagement.
- The project involves analyzing a massive dataset from a social media and content creation company managing over 100,000 daily content pieces. The analysis aims to track user reactions, identify trending content, and provide actionable insights to support the company’s goal of completing an IPO by next year and adopting best practices in big data processing.
# Objectives
- Conduct an audit of Social Buzz's big data practices to identify inefficiencies and opportunities for optimization.
- Provide recommendations for a successful IPO, ensuring the company is operationally and technically prepared.
- Perform an analysis of their content categories to identify the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity, enabling data-driven strategic decisions.
# Methodology
- Dataset Exploration: Reviewed and studied the dataset to understand its structure and components.
- Data Cleaning: Ensured the dataset was accurate, consistent, and free of errors and blanks to facilitate meaningful analysis.
- Data Modeling: Structured and modeled the data to maintain relevance and clarity during analysis.
- Table Joining: Used complex Excel functions (e.g., VLOOKUP) to join multiple data tables for a comprehensive view.
- Scoring and Insights: Calculated total scores for content categories to extract the top 5 performing categories and uncovered actionable insights.
# Insights
- The Animal category achieved the highest scores, followed by Science, Healthy Eating, and Food. To drive continued growth and maximize user engagement, efforts should focus on creating and promoting more content in these high-performing areas. These categories should also be prioritized for strategic growth initiatives and monetization opportunities.
- Conversely, the least-performing categories, Public Speaking and Veganism, require targeted attention to better align with audience preferences. Strategies such as partnering with influencers or experts in these fields and running focused marketing campaigns can help boost awareness and engagement in these underperforming areas.
# Recommendations
- Content Optimization: Focus resources on the most engaging content categories to drive user interaction.
- Influencer Collaborations: Partner with influencers to amplify the reach and engagement of trending content.
- Addressing Negative Sentiment: Develop strategies to mitigate negative user sentiment and enhance brand perception.
# Conclusion
- The Social Buzz project provided key insights into content performance, identifying top-performing categories like Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, and Food, and highlighting opportunities for growth and monetization. Underperforming areas such as Public Speaking and Veganism were addressed with actionable recommendations, including targeted campaigns and influencer collaborations.
- These findings emphasize the importance of data-driven strategies to optimize content, enhance engagement, and support a successful IPO. By implementing these recommendations, Social Buzz can strengthen its market position and achieve sustainable growth.
